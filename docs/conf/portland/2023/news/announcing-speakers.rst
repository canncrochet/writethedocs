Announcing Portland conference speakers
=======================================

Our Portland conference is happening in just under 3 months, and we're excited to see everyone again in {{city}}.
Now is a great time to start booking your tickets and travel,
and we hope to see you soon.

The biggest announcement today is our speakers and talks for the conference. 
Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to send us a proposal;
we literally wouldn't have an event without you!

Full speaker line-up
--------------------

Each year we bring a wide range of voices to the Write the Docs . Because the role of "documentarian" looks so different to each of us, we aim for a line-up that spans a good mix of practical, philosophical, and technical topics â€“ with the odd whimsical one thrown in for good measure.

We're really excited about the `presentations <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speakers/>`_ we've got this year:

We hope there's something there for everyone to enjoy, and also something that will broaden your horizons a bit.

Call for Volunteers
-------------------

We are looking for volunteers to help out at the conference and provide support with a variety of tasks: registration, A/V and tech, unconference, speaker support, and anything else that may come up.

Each individual who volunteers for two or more shifts receives a free ticket to the conference. Shifts range from 3-4 hours in length with a break during the shift.

Application will be open until we have enough volunteers signed up for the conference. This is typically mid-March.

* Check out our `volunteer application form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbnCr0Kbay2mBTe0mM7lTP85tzj9DUFD8LCyegUugk81KQGg/viewform?usp=sf_link>`_  for more information and to sign up to volunteer.

Opportunity Grants close on March 1
-----------------------------------

Applications for our Opportunity Grant program **close on March 1st**.
This program is open to anyone who would otherwise have difficulties attending the conference,
and we'd love to have more folks applying.

* `Apply for a grant <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/>`_ before the deadline.

Buy your tickets soon
---------------------

If you don't have your ticket yet, now's a great time to start the process to attend.
Conference tickets have sold out in the past,
and tickets sell faster after the speaker announcement,
so don't leave it to the last minute.

Please remember to book your travel only after you purchase a conference ticket.
With the conference returning to in-person this year, we are working hard to make sure that our attendees have a safe and comfortable experience.
This means we have capacity limits and can't guarantee late-registration tickets if you book travel without a conference ticket. 

* Read our `Convince your manager page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/convince-your-manager/>`_ to help make the case for attending.
* Buy your tickets on our `Tickets page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_.
* Plan your trip with our `Visiting Portland page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/visiting/>`_.
